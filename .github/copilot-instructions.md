Labsy is a GCC-focused print-on-demand platform that connects creators with local print factories to sell custom merchandise. The problem it solves is the lack of accessible, localized POD services in the Middle East that support Arabic language, local payment methods, and regional fulfillment.
This is a nestjs backend service that uses TypeScript. 
It is structured with a modular architecture, where each module encapsulates its own functionality. The project uses decorators extensively for defining routes, services, and entities.
The project follows best practices for dependency injection, and it uses the NestJS CLI for generating components. The codebase is organized into modules, controllers, services, and entities.
We are using postgreSQL as the database, and TypeORM for ORM functionality.
we are using firebase for authentication. 
google cloud storage is used for file uploads.
we are using yarn as the package manager.
The terminal's default directory is the root of the project, and all commands should be run from there, no need to again go the root directory.



When writing code:
- Use TypeScript syntax and NestJS conventions.
- Use decorators for defining routes, services, and entities.
- Follow the modular architecture pattern.
- Use dependency injection for services and repositories.
- Ensure proper error handling and validation.
- Use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for data validation and transformation.
- Use the NestJS CLI for generating components.
- Follow best practices for naming conventions and code organization.
- Write unit tests for services and controllers.
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations.
- Use environment variables for configuration.
- Use the `@nestjs/common` and `@nestjs/core` packages for core functionality.
- Use the `@nestjs/typeorm` package for database interactions.
- Use the `@nestjs/swagger` package for API documentation.
- Use the `class-validator` and `class-transformer` packages for DTO validation and transformation.
- Use the `rxjs` library for reactive programming.
- Use the `@nestjs/config` package for configuration management.
- Use changelogs to document changes in the codebase.
