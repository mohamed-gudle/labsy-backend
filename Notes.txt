Best Practices Moving Forward
Always generate migrations for entity changes - Don't rely on synchronize: true
Review generated migrations before running them
Use descriptive migration names that explain what they do
Test migrations on a copy of production data before deploying
Never edit existing migrations that have been run in production
Keep your entities and database in sync using migrations

bank accountinfo later
